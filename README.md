# Adaptive and Robust Control Labs

This repository contains a series of labs for the Adaptive and Robust Control course at ITMO University. Each lab focuses on different aspects of adaptive and robust control systems, providing practical exercises and theoretical background.

## Lab Structure

The repository is organized into several directories, each representing a different lab. Below is an overview of each lab:

- **Contents**:
  - `common/`: Shared resources and configurations.
  - `matlab/`: MATLAB scripts and functions.
  - `parts/`: Sections of the lab report.
  - `report.typ`: Main report file.
  - `lib.typ`: Library of Typst macros and settings.

### Lab 2
- **Description**: Robust control techniques and their applications.
- **Contents**:
  - `common/`: Shared resources and configurations.
  - `matlab/`: MATLAB scripts and functions.
  - `parts/`: Sections of the lab report.
